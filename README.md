# PHP Type Juggling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP related to type juggling and handling of null values and arrays. The `bug.php` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to implicit type conversions, while `bugSolution.php` shows the corrected version.

## Problem

PHP's loose typing allows for implicit type conversions during comparisons.  This can lead to errors if not handled carefully. For example, a comparison against null may not behave as expected if the variable is not explicitly checked for null before other type checks.

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit type checks to ensure that the code handles null values and various data types appropriately.  Using `===` (strict comparison) is crucial to avoid unintended type conversions.
